What is LSL?
************

The lab streaming layer (LSL) is a system for the unified collection of measurement time series in research experiments that handles both the networking, time-synchronization, (near-) real-time access as well as optionally the centralized collection, viewing and disk recording of the data.

The **LSL distribution** consists of the core library and a suite of tools built on top of the library.

The core transport library is `liblsl <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl/>`__ and its language interfaces (`C <https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/>`__, `C++ <https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/>`__, `Python <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Python/>`__, `Java <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Java/>`__, `C# <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Csharp/>`__, `MATLAB <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Matlab/>`__).
The library is general-purpose and cross-platform (OS Support: Win / Linux / MacOS / `Android <https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Android/>`__ / iOS; Architecture Support: x86 / amd64 / arm).

The suite of tools includes a :lslrepo:`recording program <LabRecorder>`,
`file importers <https://github.com/sccn/xdf>`__, and apps that make data from
a range of acquisition hardware (see :doc:`supported_devices`) available on the
lab network (for example audio, EEG, or motion capture).

There is an
`intro lecture/demo on LSL <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1at7yrcFW0>`__
(part of an online course on EEG-based brain-computer interfaces), as well as a 
`tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDDkrmv3ZKE>`__ with a general 
overview of LSL in use. 

Streaming Layer API
===================

The liblsl library provides the following **abstractions** for use by client programs:

.. glossary::

  Sample
    A single measurement of all channels from a device is a called a sample.

  Chunk
    A :term:`Sample` can be transferred by itself for improved latency or
    in chunks of multiple samples for improved throughput.

  Metadata
    Apart from the raw data, information about the :term:`Stream` is stored and
    transmitted as XML data (akin to a file header).

  Stream
    The combination of sampled data from a device with the :term:`Metadata`
    is called a stream.
    A stream can have a regular sampling rate (e.g. audio sampled at
    44100 Hz, videos at 24 or 60 Hz)
    or an irregular sampling rate (e.g. key presses, experimental
    events) and one or more channels
    (e.g. two channels for stereo audio, 32 / 64 channels for EEG recordings,
    1920*1080 channels for a full HD screen capture, one channel for
    key presses)
    All data within a stream is required to have the same type
    (integers, floats, doubles, strings).

  Stream Outlet
    for making time series data streams available on the lab network.
    The data is pushed sample-by-sample or chunk-by-chunk into the outlet.
    By creating an outlet the stream is made visible to a collection of
    computers (defined by the network settings/layout) where one can
    subscribe to it by find it via a :term:`Resolver` and connecting
    a :term:`Stream Inlet` to it.

  Stream Inlet
    A stream inlet is for receiving time series data from a single connected outlet.
    Allows to retrieve samples from the :term:`Stream` (in-order, with reliable
    (re-)transmission, optional type conversion and optional failure recovery).
    Besides the samples, the :term:`Metadata` can be obtained (as XML blob
    or alternatively through a small built-in DOM interface).

  Resolver
    LSL provides functions to resolve :term:`streams <Stream>` that are
    present on the lab network according to content-based queries
    (for example, by name, content-type, or queries on the meta-data).
    The service discovery features do not depend on external services such as
    zeroconf and are meant to simplify the data collection network setup.

  Built-in clock
    Allows to time-stamp the transmitted samples so that they can be mutually
    synchronized. See :doc:`time_synchronization`.

Reliability
===========

The following reliability features are implemented by the library (transparently):

- Transport inherits the reliability of TCP, is message-oriented (partitioned into samples) and type safe.
- The library provides automatic failure recovery from application or computer crashes to minimize data loss (optional); this makes it possible to replace a computer in the middle of a recording without having to restart the data collection.
- Data is buffered both at the sender and receiver side (with configurable and arbitrarily large buffers) to tolerate intermittent network failures.
- Transmission is type safe, and supports type conversions as necessary.

Time Synchronization
====================

The lab streaming layer comes with a built-in synchronized time facility for all recorded data which is designed to achieve sub-millisecond accuracy on a local network of computers. This facility serves to provide out-of-the-box support for synchronized data collection but does not preclude the use of user-supplied alternative timestamps, for example from commercial timing middleware or high-quality clocks.

The built-in time synchronization is designed after the widely deployed Network Time Protocol (NTP) and implemented in the LSL library.

This feature is explained in more detail in the :doc:`time_synchronization` document.

File Format
===========

The transport API itself does not endorse or provide a particular file format,
but the provided recording program (:lslrepo:`LabRecorder`) records into the
XDF file format (`Extensible Data Format <https://github.com/sccn/xdf>`__).
XDF was designed concurrently with the lab streaming layer and supports the
full feature set of LSL (including multi-stream container files, per-stream
arbitrarily large XML headers, all sample formats as well as
time-synchronization information).
