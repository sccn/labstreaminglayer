Developer's Guide
=================

LabStreamingLayer (LSL) is a library (liblsl) and a suite of apps and tools.

The :doc:`app_dev` guide is for you if you are:

- adding LSL support for a device to send its data to other applications;
- writing an application that receives data (e.g., to process and possibly resend on a new stream);
- trying to build an existing application that does not already have a release for your platform.

The :doc:`lib_dev` guide is for you inf you are:
- trying to build liblsl for a platform that does not already have a release
    - Please check the `liblsl release page <https://github.com/sccn/liblsl/releases>`_ first.
    - Please let us know so we can add the platform to the list of automated builds, if possible.
- trying to use liblsl in a language that does not already have an interface
    - Already supported: Android, C#, Java, Matlab, Python


# Coding Guides
The distribution includes a range of code examples in C, C++, Python, MATLAB, Java, and C# including some very simple sender and receiver programs, as well as some fairly extensive demo apps. This page includes just some simple teasers. See [[ExampleCode|ExampleCode]]for a broader overview of example programs, API documentation link, and general programming tips, tricks, and frequently asked questions.
